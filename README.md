# Stylus Supremacy

**Stylus Supremacy** extension helps formatting *[Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com)* files. It is powered by the [*NPM* package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stylus-supremacy) with the same name and developed by the same developer.

Once you have this extension installed on your *Visual Studio Code*, you can simply open a *Stylus* file, right click to open the document context menu, then choose **Format Document** or press **Shift+Alt+F** on your keyboard. The shortcut key is exactly the same as formatting a *JavaScript* file.

## Formatting options in VS Code settings

You can find **Stylus Supremacy** section in the default *Visual Studio Code* settings. There are pretty similar to the [formatting options in the original *NPM* package](https://github.com/ThisIsManta/stylus-supremacy#formatting-options), except that `tabStopChar` and `newLineChar` will be determined automatically based on the current active *Stylus* file.

## Formatting options from Stylint

If you are using *[Stylint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stylint)* as a *Stylus* linter, simply put *.stylintrc* file in the current viewing file directory up to your root directory.

For more information, please see [*Stylint* compatibility section in the original *NPM* package](https://github.com/ThisIsManta/stylus-supremacy#stylint-compatibility).
